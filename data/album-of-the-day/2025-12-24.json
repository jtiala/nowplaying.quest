  "description": "A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector is a multi-artist studio album of Christmas songs, produced by Phil Spector, originally released by Philles in November 1963. Spector treated a series of mostly secular Christmas standards to his Wall of Sound production style, and the selections feature the vocal performances of Spector's regular artists during this period. One month after its release, the album peaked at number 13 on Billboard magazine's special, year-end, weekly Christmas Albums sales chart.",
