  "description": "Blank Face LP is the fourth studio album by the American rapper Schoolboy Q. It was released on July 8, 2016, through Top Dawg Entertainment and distributed by Interscope Records. SchoolBoy Q began work on the album in July 2014, months after the release of his major label debut Oxymoron. After briefly considering retirement from rap music to spend more time with his family, he set up a home studio and resumed working on the album in the summer of 2015; it was completed in April 2016. The album's production was primarily handled TDE's in-house production team, Digi+Phonics, alongside older and newer collaborators including Swizz Beatz, Metro Boomin, Southside, Nez & Rio, DJ Dahi, The Alchemist and Tyler, the Creator. It also features guest appearances from Kanye West, Jadakiss, E-40, Tha Dogg Pound, Miguel and Anderson .Paak, among others.",
