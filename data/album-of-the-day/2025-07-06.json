  "description": "Germfree Adolescents is the 1978 debut album of English punk rock band X-Ray Spex. It contained the UK hit singles \"The Day the World Turned Dayglo\", \"Identity\" and \"Germ Free Adolescents\" which reached No. 18 in November 1978. Upon release, the critics noted it was not all new material: five songs on the twelve tracks had already been released on A-sides and B-sides of singles.",
