  "description": "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight is the second album released by Richard Thompson, and his first to include his then wife, Linda Thompson, the pair being credited as Richard and Linda Thompson. It was issued by Island Records in the UK in 1974. Although the album did not sell and was critically ignored and not released outside of the UK until 1983, by Hannibal Records, it has been described as \"a timeless masterpiece\" and considered one of the finest releases by the two singers, whether working singularly or together.",
