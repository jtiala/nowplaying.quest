  "description": "The Dock of the Bay is the first of a number of posthumously released Otis Redding albums, and his seventh studio album. It contains a number of singles, B-sides, and previously released album tracks dating back to 1965, including one of his best known songs, the posthumous hit \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\". His final recordings were finished just two days before Redding's death in a plane crash on December 10, 1967. In 2003, the album was ranked number 161 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list.",
