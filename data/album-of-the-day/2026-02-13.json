  "description": "Broken English is the seventh studio album by English singer Marianne Faithfull. It was released on 2 November 1979 by Island Records. The album marked a major comeback for Faithfull after years of drug abuse, homelessness and anorexia. It is often regarded as her definitive recording, and Faithfull herself described it as her \"masterpiece\".",
