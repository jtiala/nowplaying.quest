  "description": "Straight Outta Compton is the debut studio album by American hip-hop group N.W.A, released on January 25, 1989, through Priority and Ruthless Records. It was produced by N.W.A members Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and Arabian Prince, with lyrics written by the group's remaining members Eazy-E, Ice Cube and MC Ren, along with Ruthless rapper and N.W.A affiliate the D.O.C. Beyond depictions of Compton's street violence, the lyrics repeatedly threaten to lead it by attacking peers and even police. The track \"Fuck tha Police\" drew an FBI agent's warning letter, which aided N.W.A's notoriety, with N.W.A later calling itself \"the world's most dangerous group\".",
