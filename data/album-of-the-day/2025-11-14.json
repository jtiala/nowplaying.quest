  "description": "Hatful of Hollow is a compilation album by the English rock band the Smiths, released on 2 November 1984 in the United Kingdom, by Rough Trade Records. The album features tracks from BBC Radio 1 sessions, their first single \"Hand in Glove\" and two new singles and their B-sides. It was eventually released in the United States on 9 November 1993 by Sire Records, which had initially declined to release the album in the country. Sire instead released Louder Than Bombs in the US in 1987, which is effectively a hybrid of Hatful of Hollow and a subsequent UK compilation album The World Won't Listen, along with additional songs that do not appear on either.",
