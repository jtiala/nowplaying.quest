  "description": "Wild Honey is the thirteenth studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on December 18, 1967, by Capitol Records. It was the group's first foray into soul music and was heavily influenced by the R&B of Motown and Stax Records. The album was the band's worst-selling at that point, charting at number 24 in the US. Lead single \"Wild Honey\" peaked at number 31, while its follow-up \"Darlin'\" reached number 19. In the UK, the album peaked at number seven.",
