  "description": "Midnite Vultures is the seventh studio album by American musician Beck, released on November 16, 1999, by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying styles, it did not achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough album Odelay, but was still critically acclaimed and commercially successful.",
