  "description": "You've Come a Long Way, Baby is the second studio album by English electronic music producer Fatboy Slim. It was first released on 19 October 1998 in the United Kingdom by Skint Records and a day later in the United States by Astralwerks. You've Come a Long Way, Baby proved to be Cook's global breakthrough album, peaking at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number 34 on the US Billboard 200. Praised by critics for its sound and style, the album brought international attention to Cook, earning him a Brit Award in 1999, and was later certified four times platinum by the BPI and platinum by the RIAA. Four singles were released from the album: \"The Rockafeller Skank\", \"Gangster Tripping\", \"Praise You\", and \"Right Here, Right Now\", all of which peaked within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. \"Build It Up â€“ Tear It Down\" was also released as a promotional single.",
