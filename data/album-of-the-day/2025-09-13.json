  "description": "Unhalfbricking is the third studio album by the English folk rock band Fairport Convention and the first of two albums released by the band in 1969. It is seen as a transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, What We Did on Our Holidays and reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege & Lief, released later the same year.",
