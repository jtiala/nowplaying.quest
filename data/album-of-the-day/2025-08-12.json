  "description": "Complete Discography is a compilation album by American hardcore punk band Minor Threat, released in 1989 through the band's own Dischord Records. As the name implies, it contains the band's entire discography at the time, including their three EPs, the Out of Step album and Flex Your Head compilation tracks. Some tracks were unreleased at the time and didn't appear on this compilation, but were later released. This includes the songs \"Understand\" and \"Asshole Dub\" from 20 Years of Dischord.",
