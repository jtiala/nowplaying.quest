  "description": "Raw Power is the third studio album by American rock band the Stooges, released on February 7, 1973, by Columbia Records. The album departed from the \"groove-ridden, feel-based songs\" of the band's first two records in favor of a more anthemic hard rock approach inspired by new guitarist James Williamson, who co-wrote the album's eight songs with singer Iggy Pop.",
