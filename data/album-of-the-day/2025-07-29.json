  "description": "Songs in A Minor is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys. It was released on June 26, 2001, by J Records. A classically trained pianist, Keys wrote, arranged and produced the majority of the album herself, though she frequently worked with her then-partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers. The efforts resulted in a neo soul record fusing contemporary classical music with traditional and modern R&B, soul, jazz, hip-hop, blues, and gospel styles. Its lyrical themes center on love, perserverence, self-worth, survival, and introspection. Despite the album's title, only two of its tracks are composed in the key of A minor.",
